I took some of these tips from the book "The Secret Habits to Master Your
Art of Speaking" by Oh Su Hyang. The book is about the techniques of
communication, persuasion, and negotiation.

It's a great book for anyone who wants to improve their speaking skills. A
word that can touch the heart has its own attraction and can liven up a
situation.
