I took some of these tips from "The Secret Habits to Master Your
Art of Speaking" book by Oh Su Hyang. I borrowed the book from my friend when
we met because it's an interesting topic that can help us improve our
speaking skills.

The book is about the techniques of communication, persuasion, and negotiation.
I will list below all the summary points that I found interesting in the book.

## Communication Rules

1. Words that cannot be said in the "front" should not be said in the "back".
   Gossip is very bad.
2. Speak less and listen more.
3. Has a low voice.
4. Speak in ways that are pleasing to the heart, not just pleasing to the ear.
5. Say what the other person wants to hear, not what you want to say. Speak
   what is easy to understand, not what is easy to say.
6. Speaks by covering up disgrace and praising often.
7. Speak of things that are pleasant, not things that are unpleasant.
8. Speak with non-verbals too such as eyes and expressions.
9. 30 seconds on the lips = 30 years in the heart. A word can change a
   person's life.
10. Take responsibility for what has been said. Because the words that come out
    will control us.

## First Impression

- A word that can touch the heart has its own attraction and can liven up a
  situation.
- Avoid boasting when making a first impression.
- Make a positive first impression because there are no second chances in
  conversations.
- To improve your confidence, speak and act as if you have already succeeded.
  Speak as if it has already happened.

## Speak with Logic

- Give logical reasons for our arguments.
- Be careful in making conclusions and statements. Don't make conclusions too
  quickly or overstatements. A leap of logic is a conclusion that is not
  supported by facts or evidence.
- Be consistent with an argument or opinion from beginning to end.
- Use simple words.
- Stay calm and avoid getting upset when speaking.

## Storytelling

During interviews, focus on storytelling rather than listing your
specifications. This approach can help highlight your strengths and create
value for yourself.

Storytelling exercises are useful for improving communication skills. Here are
some ways to do storytelling:

1. It should have a standout theme. The story should be consistent with one
   theme.
2. Create a conflict that keeps people immersed in the story.
3. A story must be familiar and easy to understand in order to attract
   sympathy.
4. Can resolve conflicts with solutions.
5. Create a storyline that can provoke curiosity and concentration, but use it
   accordingly.
6. A reason that makes a story believable.

## Eliminate Nervousness

1. Assume the audience is not someone who will judge you, but will listen to
   your story with joy.
2. Avoid underestimating your own capacity when introducing yourself.
3. Learn the content well.

## 5 Non-Verbal Elements

1. Good looks for a first impression.
2. Always smile and stay calm.
3. Steady gaze.
4. Confident attitudes such as body posture.
5. Appropriate gestures such as hand gestures to make a strong point.

## One Keyword

1 right keyword is better than 10 phrases. For example, an applicant says he
will be a "global man" to the interviewer for the company which means he can
make the company global.

## Product Values

Establish good product value to compete with large rivals. And set a value
that matches the quality of the self.

Focus on 1 thing for marketing. For example, restaurants keep focusing on the
authentic taste of the cuisine to customers so that consumers will come.

## Needs Over Wants

Prioritize the consumer's needs over wants. Needs refer to the drive for
something fundamentally necessary and know the other person's problems.

### Situation Question

Questions to find out the consumer's opinion about the situation he is facing.

### Problem Question

Information from situation questions can be used to understand problems,
distress, and needs.

### Implication Question

Ask what negative impact the problem has had on the family, health and life.

### Needs-Payoff Question

We provide solutions and introduce the product as an alternative.
